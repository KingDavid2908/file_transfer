I am a student at the University of Lagos studying mechanical engineering. I would love to understand more
about simulations and machine design since it can open a career path for me. This course would help me further
my knowledge of simulations, which would not only help me achieve good grades in school but also open me to a
world of possibilities. The skills I acquired from this course would help me to solve real-world problems, 
which in turn would make my services in demand, generating income for me. Learning simulations would help me 
save cost when manufacturing since materials would not be wasted and help me save time since it would be 
easier and faster to simulate than to build a model, thereby leading to a more efficient and faster 
production process, which in turn saves cost and time and makes the production process a lot easier.  Having
learned skills in mechanical engineering design would be life-changing for me.
